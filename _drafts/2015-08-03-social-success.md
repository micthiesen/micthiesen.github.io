Well it might not be the one-and-only key, but I believe one path that could lead some people to social success lies in teaching yourself that interactions with other people *can be truly real* and do not need to be controlled by any set of rules. I base this idea on personal experience and <s>a bit</s> a lot of intense though. I'll explain more after the fold.

The basic idea is this: Many people in the world have some sort of challenge socially. Some of these people's issues may stem from a state of mind that is *out of sync with reality*. What I mean by "out of sync" is the presence of learned thought-patterns that lead to untrue conclusions &mdash; learned "truths" that are simply based on false logic. In this case, the false truth is believing that conversations and connections with other humans are mostly fake or "put on".

But the truth is that, if you let yourself, you can create strong and emotionally intense connections with other people. (Catch: the person on the other side must be willing too.) Yes, real connections that have meaningful meanings! It won't be easy to re-train yourself. I'll admit, I'm not a psychologist by any stretch of the imagination, but I know some basics. One of them which is that *habits are hard to break*. But *have an open mind*, set some time aside to seriously think about how you view the world, and you'll be heading in the right direction.

Can any of you guys relate? Comment below, if you wish!
