September 26th was our first day back as a whole team. To celebrate that event, we held Track Day, a chance for our 
new members to see and test drive our vehicles. What was simply supposed to be a preview opportunity turned out to be a moment
that inspired all  new and returning members. "Just being able to start off the year with functional vehicles puts us in a 
far better spot than we were last year," said Jonathan, a returning lead. Indeed Jonathan is correct, by having a working
vehicle, the team is able to focus its energy on modifying and finetuning rather than building the vehicle - turning a good car
into a great one.

The new recruits were also "pumped" for the upcoming year. "It is great to see what we will be working with,"  says Jason, a new 
recruit from teh engine division. "An already built car shows us the pursuit of efficiency is not just some design on a computer,
but something that can be created in real life," he continued. It is often truth that the first step is the hardest, but by 
having an already built vehicle, the direction and the vision of the team was clear. They were to create the most efficient 
gasoline powered vehicle in the world. 

The persuit of efficiency had always attracted many newcomers."The UBC Supermileage Team has always brought together people with 
different backgrounds who not only dream but want to create a brighter tomorrow," says Michael, a returning lead. It is true that
a simple purpose can bring some of the most unexpected background together. From arts to science to commerce and to engineering,
it is not the starting point that matters, but the journey where all talents come together to create a brighter and cleaner
future. 

At Track Day, many members had similar feelings as Jonathan and Jason. Everyone looked optimistally towards a new year. Some
challenges were overcome last year, but new challenges will present themsevles with time. As the gears of a new season start 
to turn, it is time to get back to work. Shell Eco-Marathon Americas 2016, here we come!
